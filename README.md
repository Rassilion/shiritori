# Project Update
I wasn't updating project over 2 years and now I even can't get it to work(lots of deprecated tool and usages).
I updated some parts and get the website work but game still doesn't start, so I'm planing to rewrite game from scratch.
I will leave repo as it is and start a new repo for the rewrite version
